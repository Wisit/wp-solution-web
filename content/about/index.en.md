# Bridging the Gap Between IT and OT

At WP Solution, we are not a traditional System Integrator that simply relies on adding more hardware to solve problems. We are an **Engineering-Driven** company focused on the convergence of **Operational Technology (OT)** and **Information Technology (IT)**.

Our core belief is that the future of manufacturing flexibility lies in **software architecture**, not just hardware controllers.

## Our Mission: Unlocking Potential with PC-Based Control

Many factories are held back by "black box" legacy machines or rigid PLC systems that cannot adapt to modern data demands. Our mission is to unlock these limitations using advanced **PC-Based Control** technologies. By leveraging powerful platforms like Industrial PCs running C# (.NET), Node-RED, and modern web technologies, we provide solutions that are vastly more flexible, scalable, and data-rich than traditional methods.

## The "Agile SI" Approach

We operate on a high-efficiency model. Instead of fielding large teams with layers of management, we rely on a lean, expert-led structure focused on direct execution and deep technical expertise.

**Why this matters to you:**

* **Direct Access to Experts:** You speak directly with the architects designing your system, ensuring nothing gets lost in translation.
* **Standardized Solutions:** We don't reinvent the wheel for every project. We build and deploy proven, standardized software modules (e.g., our PC-Based HMI framework or IIoT connectors). This ensures reliability and faster deployment times.
* **Focus on Value:** We solve the "pain points" on the factory floor with engineering precision, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Our Technical DNA

We specialize in high-performance tech stacks tailored for industrial environments:
* **Core Control & HMI:** C# (.NET/WPF) for robust PC-based applications.
* **Connectivity & IoT:** Node-RED, MQTT for seamless data integration.
* **Visualization:** Vue.js for modern, responsive web dashboards.
* **Hardware Integration:** Deep expertise in connecting with major PLC brands (Mitsubishi, Omron), Motion Controllers, and Machine Vision systems.
